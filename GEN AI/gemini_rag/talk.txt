1. it uses the old highlighted file instead of the original pdf file 
    which result in highliging the old prompt content and new prompt content which is not related to current prompt 

2. GenixChat doesn't know about the file overall which means LLM have no idea about the file content or file
    its giving the result using that context only which is insufficent 
    it should be like interacting with LLMs about the file not emmbadings 
    emmbadings are deciding what to answer instead of LLM 

    solution - try to adjest the temperacture --- it worked not all the time in abstract not worked
    but its giving the normal simple english text it has to behave like human and 
    explaing the result which got from the document

3. Big loop hole it was not even considering the pdf file content in the prompt the llm was giving the result based on its own!
